# Reflection Document
The development process for this application started with research on the API. It was interesting to refresh on how the async api call works.
Few challenges faced during development are treating the responses accordingly. some of the data are returned as an object and it takes full atention to convert them in to a readable values and display them to the page.
The solutions implemented in this project are mostly from the lesson materials found in our canvas. However, online resources also played big role in dealing with some tricky syntax and parse the data.
There are few potential improvements for this project. if I had time, first of all I would implement toggle the color scheme between light and dark mod
